Farmers performed rain-invocation rites at river shrines, offering rice wine and drum dances to dragons believed to govern monsoon cycles.^[1^] During Seollal (Lunar New Year), masked performers reenact dragon dances that echo the dragon boat ceremonies of [China](../../china/rituals/README.md) while blessing households for prosperity.^[2^]
