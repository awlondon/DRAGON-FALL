# Korea

Korean dragons (*yong*) are benevolent water spirits tied to royal authority and agricultural plenty. Texts like the *Samguk Yusa* recount imugi—serpents aspiring to become dragons—guarding rivers or aiding kings once they obtain the wish-granting yeouiju pearl.^[1^][2^] While influenced by Chinese *long*, Korean dragons typically lack wings and reflect peninsula-specific shamanic themes. Cross-sea exchanges carried these motifs to the Japanese archipelago, linking Korea's draconic lore with both [China](../china/README.md) and [Japan](../japan/README.md).^[3^]
