Mythic genealogies link Korean rulers to dragon ancestors: King Munmu of Silla vowed to become a dragon protecting the East Sea after death, inspiring maritime lineages that claim his blessing.^[1^] Folk tales of the *imugi*—serpents striving to ascend as dragons—spawn clans devoted to cultivating virtue until they earn the yeouiju and transformation, paralleling similar aspirations in [Japan](../../japan/lineage/README.md).^[2^]
