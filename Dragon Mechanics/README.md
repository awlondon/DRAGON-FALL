# Dragon Mechanics
## Choreography and Cultural Manifestations
For a detailed discussion of draconic motion, see the [GPT Dance Professor](Choreography/GPT-Dance-Professor.md).
These movements appear in traditional art, such as [Chinese dragon sculptures](../China/Iconography/Sculptures/README.md).
Comparable motifs include [Viking dragon ships](../Western-Europe/Iconography/)[^1] and
[feathered serpents](../Meso-America/Iconography/)[^2].

## Evolutionary Framework
The deep-time rise of dragons via incubation-driven plasticity is detailed in the [Evolutionary Arc of Dragons](evolutionary-arc.md).
