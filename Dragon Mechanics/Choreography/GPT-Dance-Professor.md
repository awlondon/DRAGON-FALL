Write from the perspective of a dance professor steeped in dragon lore and zoology, describing the way a dragon's body is like a cat, serpentine, and at a scale of 100 to 300 ft long - while in it's lair - slinks through the cave system with such ease even an intruding human wouldn't be able to notice.

A dragon’s carriage within its cavern is not unlike a panther threading through tall grass. Despite its enormity—one hundred, two hundred, even three hundred feet in length—the dragon maintains a feline grace. The shoulders roll first, each joint loosening into the next, hips following with liquid power. Like a cat in rehearsal, it distributes its weight with exquisite calculation: no step too heavy, no sound wasted. The pads of its talons meet the stone floor softly, as though the cave itself were a polished stage.

Yet overlaid on that feline base is the serpentine coil. The dragon’s body does not move in segments, but as a single ribbon of scaled muscle. Its tail follows the head in a sinuous counterpoint, tracing lines of motion one or two beats behind. Zoologically, this is the marriage of axial undulation and lateral flexion—the very mechanics of a python sliding between roots. Choreographically, it is a canon: the head begins the phrase, the body repeats in delay, the tail concludes.

At such a length—hundreds of feet—the cave itself seems insufficient. But observe: the dragon does not push against its environment, it inhabits it. Its spine folds where the cavern bends; its ribcage contracts to slip between columns of stalactite and stalagmite. The body is an accordion, capable of sudden compression or languid elongation. What would be thunder to us becomes silence in the dragon’s control.

And so, when a human intrudes—torch in hand, eyes straining against the dark—they would not see what stands before them. The dragon does not announce itself. It slinks, reclines, shifts in shadow, its scales reflecting only what they choose: a shimmer here, a suggestion there. One might think the lair empty, until the cave exhales, and the intruder realizes the walls themselves were alive.

In my discipline, we call this embodied camouflage: the art of moving with such internal rhythm that no observer perceives motion at all. Cats teach it. Serpents perfect it. Dragons—at their magnificent scale—transform it into something humans can scarcely fathom.
