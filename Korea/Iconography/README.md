# Iconography

Korean art depicts dragons spiralling among clouds, often guarding royal emblems or Buddhist relics; celadon ceramics from the Goryeo dynasty feature underglaze dragons chasing flaming pearls.^[1^] Palace eaves and temple rafters display painted dragons whose sinuous bodies mirror motifs found in [China](../../China/Iconography/README.md) yet retain local styles like the three-clawed foot.^[2^] Joseon-era "Unryongdo" (Cloud-and-Dragon) court paintings and the king's red dragon robe (*gonryongpo*) exemplify royal iconography, while carved dragons on Gyeongbokgung's throne hall glimmer with gold accents.^[3^][4^]
