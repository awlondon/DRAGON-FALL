# Iconography

Korean art depicts dragons spiralling among clouds, often guarding royal emblems or Buddhist relics; celadon ceramics from the Goryeo dynasty feature underglaze dragons chasing flaming pearls.^[1^] Palace eaves and temple rafters display painted dragons whose sinuous bodies mirror motifs found in [China](../../China/Iconography/README.md) yet retain local styles like the three-clawed foot.^[2^]
