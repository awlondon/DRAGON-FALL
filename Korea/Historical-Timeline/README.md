# Historical Timeline

Chronicles such as the *Samguk Sagi* and *Samguk Yusa* record dragons aiding the founding kings of Goguryeo and Silla, tying draconic omens to Korea's early state formation.^[1^] During the Goryeo and Joseon eras, court astrologers interpreted dragon apparitions as indicators of royal virtue, echoing similar practices in [China](../../China/README.md).^[2^] The Imjin War (1592â€“1598) produced tales of dragons shielding Admiral Yi Sun-sin's fleets, linking maritime defense to celestial favor.^[3^]
