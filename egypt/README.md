# Egypt

Egyptian tradition frames serpentine beings as both defenders and foes of cosmic order. The solar barque of Ra battles the chaos serpent Apep each night, while protective cobras like Wadjet encircle pharaohs and sanctuaries.^[1^][2^] These motifs mirror the cyclical floods of the Nile, casting dragons as embodiments of primordial water and renewal. Mythic echoes with the Mesopotamian dragon Tiamat reveal a shared Near Eastern dialogue on creation and chaos.^[3^] For related serpents beyond the Nile, see [Mesopotamia](../mesopotamia/README.md).
