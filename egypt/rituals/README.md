# Rituals

The "Banishing of Apep" ceremony required priests to spit, trample, and burn wax effigies of the serpent to assist Ra's victory at dawn.^[1^] Household rituals placed protective cobra amulets near doorways, a practice comparable to dragon guardians in [China](../../china/rituals/README.md).^[2^]
