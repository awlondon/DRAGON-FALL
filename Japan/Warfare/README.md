# Warfare

The Imperial Japanese Navy named vessels like the submarine *Kōryū* ("Auspicious Dragon") to invoke mythic guardianship during the Second World War.^[1^] Earlier, samurai legends credit dragon spirits with guiding arrows or raising protective fogs, motifs that echo turtle-ship tactics in [Korea](../../Korea/Warfare/README.md).^[2^]
