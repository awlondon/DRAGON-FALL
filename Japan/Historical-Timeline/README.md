# Historical Timeline

The *Kojiki* (712 CE) records the deity Susanoo slaying the eight-headed Yamata no Orochi, securing the legendary sword Kusanagi.^[1^] Medieval chronicles recount Ryūjin offering tides to imperial envoys, while Tokugawa-era folklore ties dragon sightings to volcanic eruptions, mirroring omen traditions in [Korea](../../Korea/Historical-Timeline/README.md).^[2^]
Modern divers report the submerged [Yonaguni Monument](../../megaliths/Asia/yonaguni-monument.md); its terrace-like steps inspire speculation about dragon-built waypoints beneath the sea.^[3^]
