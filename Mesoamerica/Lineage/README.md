# Lineage

The Feathered Serpent tradition spawns diverse lineages: scholarly orders claiming descent from Quetzalcoatl advocate wisdom and wind-borne travel, while warrior-priests of Kukulkan emphasise ritual combat and celestial omens.^[1^] These lineages interact with regional clans like the [NƒÅga](../../India/Lineage/README.md) through trade myths and shared reverence for serpents.^[2^]
