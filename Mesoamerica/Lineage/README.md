# Feathered Serpent Lineages

Certain Mesoamerican clans claim descent from the Feathered Serpent, inheriting roles tied to wind, rain, and sacred knowledge.

## Major Clans
- [Quetzalcoatl](Quetzalcoatl/): Sages who guard calendars and the breath of creation.^[1^]
- [Kukulkan](Kukulkan/): Yucatec seers conducting equinox rites and calling down seasonal rains.^[2^]

## Adding a New Lineage
1. Create a folder under `Mesoamerica/Lineage/` named after the new clan.
2. Add a `README.md` detailing the lineage's origin, gifts, and role in the setting.
3. Update this index with a concise synopsis and link to the new entry.
