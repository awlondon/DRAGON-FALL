# Iconography

Feathered serpent imagery appears on Teotihuacan murals, Maya stelae, and Aztec codices, combining quetzal plumes with rattlesnake bodies to symbolize the union of sky and earth.^[1^] The motif influenced later depictions in colonial-era manuscripts and resonates with serpent forms described in [Mesopotamia](../../Mesopotamia/Iconography/README.md).^[2^]
