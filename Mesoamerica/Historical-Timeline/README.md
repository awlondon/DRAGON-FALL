# Historical Timeline

Olmec carvings from La Venta (c. 900 BCE) show early serpent-bird hybrids, suggesting a primordial origin for the Feathered Serpent cult.^[1^] At Teotihuacan, the Temple of the Feathered Serpent (c. 150 CE) anchors the deity in state religion; later, Maya chronicles associate Kukulkan with the Postclassic Chichen Itza, while Aztec annals recount Quetzalcoatl's departure prior to Spanish contact.^[2^] Comparative timelines with [Egypt](../../Egypt/Historical-Timeline/README.md) illustrate simultaneous developments in serpent worship across civilizations.^[3^]

15th century CE – Mountain citadel [Ollantaytambo](../../megaliths/Americas/ollantaytambo.md) preserves megalithic terraces some link to Quetzalcoatl’s stonemasons.
