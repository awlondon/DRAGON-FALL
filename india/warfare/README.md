# Warfare

Indra's thunderbolt weapon (*vajra*) shatters Vṛtra's serpent body, a myth that informs ritual reenactments of dragon-slaying during monsoon festivals.^[1^] Historical armies painted Nāga emblems on shields and war elephants, a practice comparable to dragon standards in [Western-Europe](../../western-europe/warfare/README.md).^[2^]
