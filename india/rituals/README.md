# Rituals

Each year during Nāga Panchami, devotees offer milk and turmeric to serpent shrines, seeking protection and fertility.^[1^] Monastic traditions also perform water-libation rites to appease subterranean Nāgas, paralleling dragon ceremonies described in [Tibet](../../tibet/rituals/README.md).^[2^]
