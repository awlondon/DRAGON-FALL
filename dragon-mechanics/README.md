# Dragon Mechanics
## Choreography and Cultural Manifestations
For a detailed discussion of draconic motion, see the [GPT Dance Professor](choreography/gpt-dance-professor.md).
These movements appear in traditional art, such as [Chinese dragon sculptures](../china/iconography/sculptures/README.md).
Comparable motifs include [Viking dragon ships](../western-europe/iconography/)[^1] and
[feathered serpents](../meso-america/iconography/)[^2].
