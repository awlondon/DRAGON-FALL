# Evren

## Origin Myths
In Turkic cosmology, the Evren (also called *ejderha*) is a colossal serpent-dragon that coils around the world, alternately nurturing and threatening creation.[^1] Some Oğuz narratives describe heroes slaying an Evren to liberate their people, echoing the dragon-slayer motif shared across Eurasia.[^2]

## Cultural Role
Among nomadic Turks, Evren personified the raw forces of nature: its movements caused storms while its shed scales were said to form mountain ranges.[^1] Later folklore retained the dragon as a symbol of sovereignty; Ottoman epics mention banners with stylised evren forms to invoke cosmic protection.[^3]

## Cross-Border Influence
The word "evren" likely derived from the Iranian *azdaha* ([Azhdaha](../azhdaha/)), and many tales mirror the Persian dragon's malevolent hunger.[^2] Silk Road contacts also transmitted Chinese *long* ([Chinese Lineages](../../../china/lineage/)) imagery, blending cloud-riding motifs with the steppe serpent to produce hybrid depictions in Central Asian textiles.[^3]
