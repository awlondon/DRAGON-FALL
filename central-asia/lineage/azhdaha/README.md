# Azhdaha

## Origin Myths
The Azhdaha (from Middle Persian *azdahāg*, "serpent") descends from the terrifying three-headed *Aži Dahāka* of the Avesta, a demon forged by Angra Mainyu and bound by the hero Thraetaona.[^1][^2]

## Cultural Role
In Central Asian tales the Azhdaha haunts desert caravans and river gorges, demanding tribute or devouring travellers. Heroes who confront it earn kingship or divine favor, making the beast a foil for righteous rule.[^2] Folk rituals in Iranian and Turkestani villages dramatise its defeat to ensure rainfall and fertility.[^2]

## Cross-Border Influence
Persian merchants and migrants spread the name across the steppe; in Turkic speech it became *ejderha*, while Caucasian and Slavic storytellers adapted it as the fiery *aždaja* or *zmaj*.[^3] These shared legends link the Azhdaha to neighbouring dragons such as the Turkic [Evren](../evren/) and the Balkan [Zmaj](../../../eastern-europe/lineage/zmaj/). Chinese records also equated it with their own *long* ([Chinese Lineages](../../../china/lineage/)), prompting artistic hybrids along Silk Road routes.[^4]
