# Historical Timeline of Dragon Mythology in China

- **c. 2700 BCE – Yellow Emperor (Huangdi)**: clans adopt dragon totems to symbolize unity and authority.
- **c. 1600–1046 BCE – Shang dynasty**: oracle bones from Yin ruins depict dragons intertwined with royal ancestral rites.
- **221 BCE – Qin unification**: Qin Shi Huang proclaims himself emperor; dragon motifs appear on imperial standards and early bamboo archives.
- **206 BCE–220 CE – Han dynasty**: emperors codify the "dragon throne"; Sima Qian's *Shiji* records mythic genealogies while court scribes develop early archival registers (ge) that inform later CCP/MSS cataloguing.
- **618–907 – Tang dynasty**: state archives classify dragon robes and banners as imperial property; dragons emblazon the Tang code scrolls.
- **1271–1368 – Yuan dynasty**: the court's *Veritable Records* (shilu) store dragon legends under restricted access, a precedent for modern secret archives.
- **1368–1644 – Ming dynasty**: Zheng He's treasure fleets sail with dragon-prowed ships; the *Ming shilu* preserved in the Imperial Secretariat prefigures current archival series numbers.
- <a id="qing-dynasty"></a>**1644–1912 – Qing dynasty**: the azure dragon flag becomes a state emblem; the Imperial Household Department archives these banners—today held in the First Historical Archives.
- **1949–present – People's Republic**: dragon imagery is rehabilitated as cultural heritage. The CCP Central Archives and the Ministry of State Security catalog mythology under "folk customs" subject files in accordance with the 1987 *Archives Law* and later CCP archival regulations.

*Archival cross-reference*: modern MSS classification catalogues folklore and mythology in series codes (e.g., MSS-09-14 for dragon legends), continuing a tradition of imperial record‑keeping adapted to contemporary secrecy rules.
