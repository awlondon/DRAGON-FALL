# Chinese Dragons

Chinese dragons (龍, *long*) embody the union of power and benevolence. Unlike their fire-breathing Western counterparts, they are patrons of rain, rivers, and imperial authority. Early chronicles such as Sima Qian's *Records of the Grand Historian* depict dragons as omens that legitimize dynastic rule, while the *Zizhi Tongjian* records their appearance as celestial portents during times of upheaval.^[1^][2]

Within the global "Dragon-Fall" narrative, Chinese dragons form the Eastern bulwark. Their retreat from the world unbalances the monsoon cycles and weakens the Mandate of Heaven, setting the stage for the wider collapse chronicled across this repository.
