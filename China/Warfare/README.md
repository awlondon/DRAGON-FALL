## Dragon Banners and Standards
- The five-clawed yellow dragon adorned imperial banners during the Ming and Qing dynasties, symbolizing the emperor's exclusive authority over the military and the realm.[^1]
- Regulations in the *Ming shi* restricted such banners to imperial forces, with the dragon often shown clutching a pearl or sun to signify cosmic power.[^1]

## Naval Dragons
- Zheng He's treasure fleets (1405–1433) sailed with carved dragon figureheads on their flagship prows to project imperial prestige on distant expeditions.[^2]

## Modern Unit Nicknames
- Dragon imagery persists in the PLA, such as the Airborne Corps' "Flying Dragons" helicopter regiment, whose emblem entwines a stylized dragon with rotor blades to suggest speed and striking power.[^3]

## Historical Example: Ming Fire Lances
- The Ming army employed fire lances (*huǒqiāng*): spears tipped with gunpowder tubes that expelled flames and shrapnel, bridging incendiary weapons and early firearms.[^4][^5]
