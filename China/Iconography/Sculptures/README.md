# Dragon Sculptures

Stone and bronze sculptures across China portray dragons in flowing, serpentine poses, embodying the slinking motions detailed in the [choreographic analysis](../../../Dragon%20Mechanics/Choreography/GPT-Dance-Professor.md).

# 唐 鎏金青銅走龍 (Tang Gilt-Bronze Running Dragon)

The Hejia Village hoard in Xi'an yielded a small gilt-bronze sculpture of a "running" dragon.  Muscular haunches and poised forepaws give it a cat-like readiness to spring, while the extended body and undulating tail twist in a serpentine S-curve that anticipates later depictions of dragons in motion.

Forged in the [Tang dynasty](../../Historical-Timeline/README.md#618907--tang-dynasty), the piece exemplifies imperial workshops' fascination with fluid animal forms rendered in precious metal.  For choreographic ideas on how such a creature might move, consult the [GPT Dance Professor's movement style](../../../Dragon%20Mechanics/Choreography/GPT-Dance-Professor.md).
