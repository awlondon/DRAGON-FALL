# Chinese Dragon Iconography

Chinese dragons symbolize power and auspiciousness. Two common motifs are shown below.

## Five-Clawed Dragons
Imperial dragons are depicted with five claws, a symbol reserved for the emperor and central authority. The five-claw standard was codified during the [Qing dynasty](../Historical-Timeline/README.md#qing-dynasty), with princes and officials limited to four or three claws.

## Cloud Scrolls
Cloud scrolls (yunwen) represent celestial movement and often accompany dragons in art, filling backgrounds with swirling energy.
