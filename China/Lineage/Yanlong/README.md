# Yanlong Lineage

## Modern Members
- **Yan Zhenqing** – Tang dynasty calligrapher revered for upright script and loyal service.[^1]
- **Zhang Yanlong** – Setter for China’s national men’s volleyball squad during the 2015 World League.[^2]
- **Yanlong, the Flame Dragon** – Legendary beast said to dwell beneath volcanic peaks in southern myths.[^3]

## Historical Background
The compound *Yanlong* (Flame Dragon) evokes both conflagration and flight, merging the fiery radical with the dragon’s soaring reach. Chronicles from the Tang through Ming periods describe generals surnamed Yan whose banners bore dragon motifs, linking martial valor with elemental fire.[^4]

## Ancient Role in Dragon Lore
In game lore, the Yanlong lineage tempers destructive blaze into protective warmth. Their watch posts ring volcanoes and forge halls, harnessing searing breath to craft weapons that bind to heroic spirits.
