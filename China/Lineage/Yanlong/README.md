# Yanlong Lineage

## Modern Members
- **Yan Zhenqing** – Tang dynasty calligrapher revered for upright script and loyal service.[^1]
- **Zhang Yanlong** – Setter for China’s national men’s volleyball squad during the 2015 World League.[^2]
- **Yanlong, the Flame Dragon** – Legendary beast said to dwell beneath volcanic peaks in southern myths.[^3]

## Historical Background
The compound *Yanlong* (Flame Dragon) evokes both conflagration and flight, merging the fiery radical with the dragon’s soaring reach. Chronicles from the Tang through Ming periods describe generals surnamed Yan whose banners bore dragon motifs, linking martial valor with elemental fire.[^4]

## Ancient Role in Dragon Lore
In game lore, the Yanlong lineage tempers destructive blaze into protective warmth. Their watch posts ring volcanoes and forge halls, harnessing searing breath to craft weapons that bind to heroic spirits.

Yanlong, the Flame Dragon, blazes through tales of southern frontier tribes and early agrarian experimentation. Chronicles of the Warring States mention envoys bringing "yanlong scales" from the Chu domain, possibly dyed turtle shells that sparked stories of a fire-breathing beast. Han alchemists, fascinated by combustive minerals, borrowed the name for their furnaces, claiming that a dragon spirit guided the transformation of cinnabar into elixirs. These fragmentary records hint at a lineage born from the meeting of pyrotechnic science and myth. During the Three Kingdoms, metallurgists in Shu claimed shimmering dragons danced above their forges, promising blades that would never dull.

In legend, Yanlong coils around volcanic ridges, stirring magma to forge weapons and hardy ceramics. Villagers near modern-day Yunnan recount that a dragon of fire erupted from Mount Ailao to warn of approaching invaders; historians suspect the tale commemorates actual volcanic activity or signal bonfires, yet it granted the lineage a martial aura. Ritual texts from southwestern temples portray Yanlong as steward of the southern quadrant's fiery energy, charged with kindling the sun each dawn and tempering the passions of warriors. Travelers along the Tea Horse Road recalled warm winds rising from ravines at dusk, which they took as Yanlong's breath guiding caravans through perilous passes.

## Known Associations

- **Mount Ailao, Yunnan** – local folklore links the mountain's geothermal vents to appearances of Yanlong; geological surveys reveal volcanic remnants but cannot confirm cultural continuity.
- **Shennong (Yan Emperor)** – agricultural legends tie this mythic ruler to the flame dragon, though the connection may stem from the shared character "yan" rather than a proven cultic lineage.
- **Yunnanese kilns and smithies** – workshops specializing in bronze and pottery invoked Yanlong for successful firings; archaeological evidence of accompanying dragon iconography remains sparse and often disputed.

## Mythic Origin
The Yanlong lineage emerges from a fiery pearl that fell from the heavens, birthing a dragon whose flames forged the first metal tools for humankind.

## Modern Presence
Contemporary Yanlong guilds operate foundries and pyrotechnic troupes, blending traditional metallurgy with modern spectacle.

## Notable Figures
- **Zhu Rong** – ancient fire deity who taught humanity to control flame.[^1]
- **Huo Qubing** – Han cavalry general renowned for blazing raids against the Xiongnu.[^2]
- **Li Tian** – Tang artisan credited with inventing fireworks.[^3]

## Ancient Familial Roles
Members served as royal smiths, keepers of hearth temples, and advisers on the ritual use of fire during state ceremonies.

## Modern Activities
The clan sponsors fireworks festivals, researches high-temperature alloys, and collaborates with cultural troupes to preserve fire-dance traditions.
