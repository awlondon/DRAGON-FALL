# Longwei Lineage

## Modern Members
- **Long Wei** – Defender in the Chinese Super League noted for disciplined tackles.[^1]
- **Wei Zheng** – Tang dynasty chancellor famed for frank remonstrations to Emperor Taizong.[^2]
- **Dick Wei (Lung Wei)** – Taiwanese martial artist whose stage name evokes “dragon might.”[^3]

## Historical Background
The term *Longwei* (Dragon’s Might) historically praised those whose authority carried the awe of mythic beasts. Officials like Wei Zheng were lauded for tempering imperial power, while modern athletes continue the martial association of the name, embodying a controlled but formidable presence on the field.

## Ancient Role in Dragon Lore
In the narrative of the game world, the Longwei lineage channels the dragon’s force into human guardians. Tasked with projecting the empire’s strength, they stand at fortress gates and palace steps, their mandate to radiate fearlessness that deters chaos before battle is ever joined.
