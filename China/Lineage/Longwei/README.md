# Longwei

Longwei, whose name evokes the "majestic awe" of the dragon, surfaces in scattered texts from the late Zhou and early imperial periods. Bronze inscriptions speak of "long wei" as the shimmering presence behind the throne, a metaphor for the emperor's moral charisma. By the Ming dynasty the phrase had become personified: storytellers described Longwei as a spectral dragon coiled above the palace rafters, his scales reflecting the virtues of the ruler below. Court artists painted him with clouded eyes, suggesting that his gaze judged ministers and generals alike. Traveling bards spread tales of Longwei's roar echoing through imperial corridors whenever court intrigue threatened the Mandate of Heaven.

Legend assigns Longwei the duty of safeguarding dynastic authority. When the imperial seal was paraded before troops, chroniclers claimed they saw a dragon's shadow trailing the bearer, warning would-be usurpers. Scholar-officials debated whether Longwei was an ancestral spirit or a poetic device; nevertheless, bureaucrats performed small rites at archives and granaries, asking the dragon to guard their records and provisions. The lineage thus melded practical statecraft with mythic guardianship. Stories from provincial archives insist that officials who neglected offerings awoke to find their inkstones dry, a warning said to come from Longwei himself.
