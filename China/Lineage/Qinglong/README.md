# Qinglong Lineage

## Modern Members
- **Li Qinglong** – PLAAF fighter pilot selected for China’s inaugural taikonaut corps.[^1]
- **Qinglong, the Azure Dragon** – Celestial guardian of the east in the Four Symbols tradition.[^2]
- **Wang Qinglong** – Hydrologist whose watershed models inform Yellow River management strategies.[^3]

## Historical Background
Adopting the title *Qinglong* aligns the lineage with the eastern quarter and the vital energies of spring. Historical gazetteers note officials bearing the name who served in frontier garrisons, reflecting the clan’s association with renewal and vigilant watch on the empire’s sunrise borders.[^4]

## Ancient Role in Dragon Lore
Mythology assigns the Qinglong lineage stewardship over rivers and planting seasons. In the game’s chronicles, they ride the seasonal winds, guiding seedlings and sailors alike as the year’s first thunder rolls across the eastern sky.
