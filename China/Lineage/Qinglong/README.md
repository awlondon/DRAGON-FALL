# Qinglong Lineage

## Modern Members
- **Li Qinglong** – PLAAF fighter pilot selected for China’s inaugural taikonaut corps.[^1]
- **Qinglong, the Azure Dragon** – Celestial guardian of the east in the Four Symbols tradition.[^2]
- **Wang Qinglong** – Hydrologist whose watershed models inform Yellow River management strategies.[^3]

## Historical Background
Adopting the title *Qinglong* aligns the lineage with the eastern quarter and the vital energies of spring. Historical gazetteers note officials bearing the name who served in frontier garrisons, reflecting the clan’s association with renewal and vigilant watch on the empire’s sunrise borders.[^4]

## Ancient Role in Dragon Lore
Mythology assigns the Qinglong lineage stewardship over rivers and planting seasons. In the game’s chronicles, they ride the seasonal winds, guiding seedlings and sailors alike as the year’s first thunder rolls across the eastern sky.

Qinglong, the Azure Dragon, stands among the Four Symbols of early Chinese cosmology and anchors the eastern quadrant of the heavens. Han-era star charts depict his sinuous body winding through the constellations of the Green Dragon, a celestial marker for the arrival of spring. Archaeological finds from Mawangdui reveal silk banners painted with a blue-green dragon facing the rising sun, suggesting ritual veneration tied to seasonal renewal. Historians read these images as evidence that the Qinglong lineage arose from astronomical observation as much as from mythic imagination.

Legend elaborates that Qinglong patrols the eastern seas, summoning tides that cleanse river mouths and ports. Sailors offered him carved wooden dragons before voyages, hoping his protection would steer them away from typhoons. In military lore, Qinglong brandished a verdant blade and guarded the empire's eastern flank, mirroring the duty later memorialized in temple murals where he wrestles a white tiger over dominion of the horizon. Even today, Daoist liturgies align altars to the east when invoking Qinglong, inviting spring breezes and strategic clarity. Ancient fishermen claimed his roar echoed in waves smashing against Shandong's cliffs, a portent of imminent spring rains. To neglect his rites, sailors warned, invited barnacles and misfortune.
