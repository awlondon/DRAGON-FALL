# Huanglong Clan

## Mythic Origin
According to legend, the Huanglong clan descends from the Yellow Dragon that rose from the Luo River to announce the Mandate of Heaven to the early tribes of the Central Plain. The dragon's emergence marked the birth of order and the rise of the Yellow Emperor.

## Modern Presence
Today the clan maintains archives and ritual sites in Henan and Shaanxi, promoting cultural heritage programs that celebrate their association with imperial legitimacy and earth-centered rites.

## Notable Figures
- **Huangdi** – mythic first emperor and patron of the clan.[^1]
- **Leizu** – empress credited with discovering sericulture.[^2]
- **Zhang Daoling** – Daoist master who invoked the Yellow Dragon in celestial teachings.[^3]

## Ancient Familial Roles
Elders served as ritual mediators to the earth deity, while younger members kept agricultural calendars and advised rulers on geomancy.

## Modern Activities
Clan associations host festivals during the fifth lunar month, fund archaeological projects, and sponsor lecture series on early imperial history.
