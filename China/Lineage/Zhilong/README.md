# Zhilong Lineage

## Modern Members
- **Zheng Zhilong** – Ming dynasty admiral and merchant who commanded vast maritime networks.[^1]
- **Quan Zhilong (G-Dragon)** – South Korean musician whose Chinese stage name signifies “aspiration of the dragon.”[^2]
- **Zhilong Chan Master** – Buddhist monk recorded in Song-era monastic biographies for performing rain-invoking rites.[^3]

## Historical Background
The name *Zhilong* combines “aspiration” with “dragon,” a formula adopted by coastal merchants and monks seeking imperial favor. Maritime gazetteers credit Zheng Zhilong with defending Fujian’s shores, while temple chronicles recount monks of the name petitioning dragons for rain in drought-stricken prefectures.[^4]

## Ancient Role in Dragon Lore
Game tradition casts the Zhilong lineage as navigators between realms. Bearing the dragon’s ambition, they chart sea lanes and spiritual currents alike, ensuring that messages from heaven reach the mortal world through mist-laden harbors.
