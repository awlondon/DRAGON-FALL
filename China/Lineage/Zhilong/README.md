# Zhilong Lineage

## Modern Members
- **Zheng Zhilong** – Ming dynasty admiral and merchant who commanded vast maritime networks.[^1]
- **Quan Zhilong (G-Dragon)** – South Korean musician whose Chinese stage name signifies “aspiration of the dragon.”[^2]
- **Zhilong Chan Master** – Buddhist monk recorded in Song-era monastic biographies for performing rain-invoking rites.[^3]

## Historical Background
The name *Zhilong* combines “aspiration” with “dragon,” a formula adopted by coastal merchants and monks seeking imperial favor. Maritime gazetteers credit Zheng Zhilong with defending Fujian’s shores, while temple chronicles recount monks of the name petitioning dragons for rain in drought-stricken prefectures.[^4]

## Ancient Role in Dragon Lore
Game tradition casts the Zhilong lineage as navigators between realms. Bearing the dragon’s ambition, they chart sea lanes and spiritual currents alike, ensuring that messages from heaven reach the mortal world through mist-laden harbors.

Zhilong, often rendered as the "Auspicious Dragon," enters historical record through the turbulent maritime trade of the seventeenth century. Merchants and missionaries along the South China coast wrote of a Fujianese seafarer named Zheng Zhilong whose surname echoed the dragon's title. While Zheng was undeniably human—a trader, pirate, and later Ming loyalist—folk storytellers elevated him into the earthly avatar of the Zhilong lineage. They claimed a sea dragon guided his fleet through typhoons and whispered routes to hidden harbors, intertwining biography with myth. Local ballads say the dragon's whiskers became the morning mists that shroud the Min River each dawn.

Legends describe Zhilong's duty as mastering oceanic currents, ensuring safe passage for those who honored him and wrecking ships of the faithless. Coastal villages erected shrines where sailors burned incense before voyages, asking the dragon to steady their rudders. When Zheng's son Zheng Chenggong (Koxinga) expelled the Dutch from Taiwan, rumors spread that a translucent dragon soared above the battle, validating the family's celestial patronage. Historians note that such tales served political ends, bolstering Ming resistance through supernatural legitimacy. Portuguese records from Macao mention coins engraved with a dragon and the character "zhi," though it remains unclear whether these commemorated Zheng himself or a broader maritime cult.
