# Traditional Rites

## Rainmaking (祈雨 qíyǔ)
- **Core Rite**: Communities erected an altar, offered incense and sacrificial animals (often a black ox), beat drums, and invited Daoist or Buddhist clergy to petition Heavenly powers or the Dragon Kings for rain. The rites appear in the "Rain Master" section of the *Rites of Zhou* and the "Monthly Ordinances" of the *Book of Rites (Lǐjì).* 
- **Regional Variations**:
  - **North China** – Daoist liturgies dominate; villagers may march straw or clay "dragon" effigies to the temple and immerse them in a river to "awaken" rain.
  - **South & Southeast** – Fujian and Guangdong communities petition maritime deities such as Mazu; Hakka groups incorporate shamanic trance and pig's-head offerings.
  - **Southwest minorities** – Naxi, Miao and other groups employ bronze drums and masked nuó performers to summon the rain.
- **Implements**: temporary altars, spirit tablets or images of Dragon Kings, incense burners, drums, animal offerings, and sometimes a straw or wooden dragon.

## Imperial Processions (巡幸 xúnxìng / 大驾)
- **Core Rite**: The emperor's formal outings—inspection tours, sacrifices at temples, or enthronement ceremonies—were choreographed displays of power. Statutes in the *Da Ming Huìdiǎn* and *Qing Huìdiǎn* specify the order of march: dragon-emblazoned banners and parasols, musicians, guards with halberds, officials ranked by colored robes, and the imperial carriage or sedan under a yellow canopy.
- **Regional/Dynastic Variations**:
  - **Ming dynasty** – Processions from Nanjing or Beijing reflected a Confucian ideal of austerity, though reports of Zhu Di's "southern tours" show elaborate military escorts.
  - **Qing dynasty** – Manchu rulers added Inner Asian elements: archers, cavalry banners, and shamanic drums during tours to Chengde or the Eastern Tombs.
  - **Imperial ploughing rites** – often in Beijing, the emperor personally tilled a sacred field with a gold or jade-inlaid plough before returning in a small palanquin.
- **Implements**: imperial carriage/palanquin, yellow parasols, ceremonial weapons, court musicians' instruments, rank-specific banners and sashes, plough for agricultural rites.

## Dragon Dances (舞龙 wǔlóng)
- **Core Rite**: Performed chiefly at Lantern Festival or New Year, a team manipulates a long, segmented dragon made of bamboo hoops and painted cloth while another performer teases it with a "pearl" on a pole. Drums and gongs coordinate undulating motions symbolizing prosperity and rain. Song-era texts such as *Wǔlín Jiǔshì* and *Méng Liáng Lù* already describe large "dragon lantern" performances in Hangzhou.
- **Regional Variations**:
  - **Northern style** – Larger, heavier dragons; athletic jumps and martial stunts emphasize dragon strength.
  - **Cantonese/Southern style** – Lighter dragons with bright scales and agile footwork; often accompanied by lion dances.
  - **Hong Kong's Tai Hang Fire Dragon** – A unique Mid-Autumn variant where a straw dragon embedded with burning incense is paraded nightly.
- **Implements**: dragon frame (bamboo or rattan), painted cloth or paper scales, detachable head and tail, "pearl" ball, poles for each segment, drums, gongs, and cymbals.
