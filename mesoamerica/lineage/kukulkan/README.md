# Kukulkan

Kukulkan, the Yucatec Maya manifestation of the Feathered Serpent, commands winds and brings seasonal rains to the Yucat√°n Peninsula.^[1^] During equinoxes at Chichen Itza, sunlight forms a serpent shadow on El Castillo's staircase, symbolizing his descent and linking astronomy to ritual power also celebrated in [Quetzalcoatl's](../quetzalcoatl/README.md) traditions.^[2^]
