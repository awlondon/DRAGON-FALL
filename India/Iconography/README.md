# Iconography

Temple reliefs across India depict Nāgas coiling protectively around sacred tanks and palace thresholds, their hoods flared like cobras to signal alert guardianship.^[1^] Shrines such as Kerala's Mannarasala Temple enshrine thousands of serpent stones beneath forest groves, while sculpted five- and seven-hooded cobras crown stairways at Hoysala and Jain sites.^[2^] Images of Viṣṇu reclining on the serpent Śeṣa illustrate cosmic balance and mirror serpent-throne motifs seen in [Egypt](../../Egypt/Iconography/README.md).^[3^]
