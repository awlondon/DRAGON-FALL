# Rituals

Each year during Nāga Panchami, devotees offer milk and turmeric to serpent shrines, seeking protection and fertility.^[1^] Regional observances such as Andhra's Nagula Chavithi and Kerala's Mannarasala Ayilyam parade serpent icons and perform snake-grove processions.^[2^][3^] Monastic traditions also conduct water-libation rites to appease subterranean Nāgas, paralleling dragon ceremonies in [Tibet](../../Tibet/Rituals/README.md).^[4^]
