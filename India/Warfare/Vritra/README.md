# Vritra

Indra's war against Vṛtra forms the archetypal serpent-slaying episode of Vedic literature, anchoring the early timeline described in [Historical Timeline](../../Historical-Timeline/README.md). The thunder-god, aided by the **vajra** fashioned from the sage Dadhīci's bones, cleaves the asura's coils and releases the world's rivers, an act celebrated in soma sacrifices.^[1^][2^]
