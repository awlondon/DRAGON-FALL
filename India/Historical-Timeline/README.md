# Historical Timeline

Vedic hymns of the *Rigveda* recount Indra's battle with the drought-serpent Vṛtra, one of the earliest Indo-European dragon-slayer myths (c. 1500 BCE).^[1^] The *Mahabharata* and Puranas later expand Nāga genealogies, describing serpent kingdoms beneath rivers and seas, while Buddhist chronicles place Nāga kings at the Buddha's sermons, paralleling dragon narratives in [Japan](../../Japan/Historical-Timeline/README.md).^[2^]
