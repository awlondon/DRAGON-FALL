# Lineage

Indian lore traces numerous NƒÅga lineages: the royal serpent Vasuki coils around Shiva's neck as a sign of allegiance, while Shesha upholds the world as a cosmic foundation.^[1^] Devotees of these lineages form guardian orders that exchange mythic insights with the Feathered Serpent priests of [Mesoamerica](../../Mesoamerica/Lineage/README.md).^[2^]
