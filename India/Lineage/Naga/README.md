# Naga

The *Mahābhārata* traces Nāga ancestry to the sage Kaśyapa and his wife Kadru, whose sons include the thousand-hooded Śeṣa, the chieftain Vāsuki, and Takṣaka ruler of forest clans.^[1^] Purāṇic genealogies place their kingdoms in subterranean Bhogavatī and riverine domains, intertwining with human dynasties through marriage and warfare myths like the snake-sacrifice of Janamejaya recounted under [Warfare](../../Warfare/README.md).^[2^]
