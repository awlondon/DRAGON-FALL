# Vritra

Vṛtra, the drought-serpent slain by Indra, emerges in Vedic lore as an asura forged by the craftsman-god Tvaṣṭṛ to avenge his son.^[1^] Purāṇic texts classify him among the Dānava offspring of Diti and recount brothers like Namuci, situating his fall as a foundational war myth explored in [Warfare](../../Warfare/Vritra/README.md).^[2^]
