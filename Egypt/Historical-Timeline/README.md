# Historical Timeline

Pyramid Texts of the Old Kingdom recount Ra's nightly battles with the serpent Apep, establishing a cosmic cycle of order versus chaos (c. 2400 BCE).^[1^] During the New Kingdom, temple inscriptions describe priests performing rituals to mutilate Apep effigies, practices that persisted into the Greco-Roman era and influenced serpent lore in [India](../../India/Historical-Timeline/README.md).^[2^]
Construction of the [Giza Complex](../../megaliths/Africa/giza-complex.md) around 2560 BCE displays stellar alignments that some dragon scholars attribute to fire-winged architects.^[3^] Further south, enigmatic [stone circles](../../megaliths/Africa/stone-circles-south-africa.md) dot the veld; folklore suggests these mark draconic energy nodes.^[4^]
