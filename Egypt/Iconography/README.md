# Iconography

Egyptian art portrays the uraeus cobra rearing atop pharaonic crowns, symbolising the goddess Wadjet's protection.^[1^] Tomb paintings also depict the chaos serpent Apep being cut to pieces, imagery that finds thematic parallels in dragon-slaying scenes from [Mesopotamia](../../Mesopotamia/Iconography/README.md).^[2^]
