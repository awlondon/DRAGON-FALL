## Results and Discussion

High-speed imaging demonstrated that explosions begin when reactants from the reservoir contact catalytic cells lining the reaction chamber. The resulting pressure rise displaces cuticular valves, ejecting a hot spray pulse. Elastic recoil then reseats the valve, halting flow until the next cycle. This feedback loop explains how small anatomical features mediate the impressive pulsation observed in the field.

The study suggests potential biomimetic applications, including blast-mitigation systems and microfluidic pulse jets inspired by the beetle's robust yet lightweight anatomy.
