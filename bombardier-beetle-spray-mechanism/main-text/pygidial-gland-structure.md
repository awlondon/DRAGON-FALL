## Pygidial Gland Structure

Each beetle possesses paired pygidial glands composed of a **reservoir chamber (RSC)** that stores hydroquinones and hydrogen peroxide, a **reaction chamber (RXC)** where the reactants mix, and a narrow **exit channel (EC)** that directs the spray. The chambers are separated by an inter‑chamber valve supported by reflector plates. Valve muscles meter the flow of reactants from RSC to RXC, and their cyclic actuation drives pulsation.

The cuticle lining these structures is a composite of chitin, structural proteins, and waxes. This tough material resists heat and chemical attack, preventing self‑injury while the beetle discharges its boiling spray.
