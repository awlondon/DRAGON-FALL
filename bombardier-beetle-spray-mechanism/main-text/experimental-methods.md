## Experimental Methods

Researchers combined multiple imaging techniques to capture internal dynamics. Synchrotron X‑ray radiography, operated at up to 2000 frames per second, revealed the motion of valves and reacting fluids inside the opaque cuticle. Complementary optical high‑speed video documented external spray trajectories, while scanning electron microscopy detailed cuticular textures and chamber morphology.
