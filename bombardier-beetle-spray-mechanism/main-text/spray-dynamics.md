## Spray Dynamics

The defensive discharge operates as a biological pulse jet. Within the reaction chamber, exothermic decomposition flashes the mixture into vapor, generating rapid pressure spikes that expel fluid parcels through the exit channel. These bursts repeat at hundreds of cycles per second—reported frequencies range from 368 to 735 Hz depending on species and temperature.

Vapor expansion and chamber recoil limit each pulse, allowing the valve to reopen and admit fresh reactants. Mechanical models liken this sequence to a relaxation oscillator whose timing is governed by cuticular elasticity and muscle response.
