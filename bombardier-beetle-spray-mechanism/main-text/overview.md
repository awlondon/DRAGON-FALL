## Overview

Bombardier beetles are among the few animals that weaponize an internal explosive reaction. By mixing chemical reactants in a reaction chamber, they heat a quinone-based spray to roughly 100 °C and expel it at velocities approaching 10 m/s. Earlier studies documented these remarkable temperatures and speeds, yet the physical basis for the spray's pulsation and control remained unclear.
