## Figures

### Figure 1. Pygidial gland anatomy
Diagram labeling the reservoir chamber (RSC), reaction chamber (RXC), exit channel (EC), and inter‑chamber valve. The reflector plates supporting the valve are highlighted.

### Figure 2. Synchrotron X‑ray sequence
High-speed radiographs captured at 2000 fps showing valve displacement and vapor formation during successive spray pulses.

### Figure 3. Spray temperature and velocity
Plots of measured spray temperatures (~100 °C) and exit velocities (~10 m/s) for multiple beetle species.
