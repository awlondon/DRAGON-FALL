Bombardier beetles defend themselves by rapidly mixing hydroquinones and hydrogen peroxide inside paired pygidial glands. The reaction generates a boiling, quinone-rich spray expelled in a series of high-pressure pulses. Using high-speed synchrotron X-ray imaging and microscopy, the authors showed that pulsation is governed by specialized cuticular structures positioned between the reservoir and reaction chambers.
