# Iconography

Babylonian art displays the mušḫuššu, a horned serpent-dragon with lion forelegs and eagle talons, prominently on the Ishtar Gate.^[1^] Cylinder seals from Sumer depict entwined serpents flanking tree-of-life motifs, imagery that later resonates in [Mesoamerica](../../Mesoamerica/Iconography/README.md).^[2^]
