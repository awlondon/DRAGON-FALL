# Dragon Fall Research Repository

This repository gathers historical and cultural research that will form the basis of **Dragon Fall**, a massive multiplayer game set in an alternative history where dragons are essential to civilization and to the advancement of player lineages.

The project documents two intertwined threads:

- **Dragon lineages** – tracing the origins, migrations, and influences of dragon bloodlines across different regions and eras.
- **Hunter lineages** – investigating orders and dynasties, such as the Knights Templar and their counterparts on other continents, that sought to destroy, control, or profit from dragons and their descendants.

Materials are organized by geographical area and gameplay mechanic to support world‑building, quest design, and lineage development for players.
