# Contributing to Dragon-Fall

Thank you for your interest in expanding this archive of global dragon lore. These guidelines keep the repository organised and ensure that sources are properly credited.

## Citation style

- Back every factual statement with a reference.
- Use inline citations in the form `【n†Lx-Ly】`, where `n` corresponds to an entry in a **Sources** list at the end of the document and `Lx-Ly` indicate the line span in the source.
- Provide full bibliographic details or stable URLs for each source in the **Sources** section.

## Directory structure

The repository is organised primarily by region:

- `China`, `Korea`, `Japan`, `India`, `Tibet`, `Mesoamerica`, `Mesopotamia`, `Egypt`, `Central-Asia`, `Eastern-Europe`, and `Western-Europe`.
- Each regional folder may contain subdirectories such as `Historical Timeline`, `Iconography`, `Lineage`, `Rituals`, `Warfare`, and `Dragon Mechanics`.
- Additional thematic folders like `Dragon Mechanics`, `megaliths`, and `bombardier-beetle-spray-mechanism` house cross-cultural research.

When adding new material:

- Place files in the appropriate region and subdirectory.
- Create a `README.md` explaining the purpose of any new folder.
- Keep filenames descriptive and use Markdown for text.

## Pull-request etiquette

1. Use a dedicated branch for your work and keep each pull request focused.
2. Ensure every new or modified Markdown file includes proper citations and a **Sources** section.
3. Run available checks (e.g., `pytest`) before submitting your pull request.
4. Use clear, descriptive commit messages.
5. Provide a concise summary of your changes in the pull request description and link related issues when possible.
6. Be responsive to review feedback and update your pull request as needed.
