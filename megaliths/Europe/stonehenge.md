# Stonehenge

## Overview
Stonehenge in Wiltshire, England, comprises massive sarsen and bluestone blocks arranged in concentric rings. Dated between 3000–2000 BCE, its solstitial alignments and unknown builders make it a perennial archaeological enigma highlighted by Ancient Connection.

## Dragon Hypothesis
Dragons might have softened stones with searing breath and transported them by flight, arranging the monument as a ceremonial calendar and boundary marker for draconic territories across Britain.

## Connections to Dragon Lore
Legendary accounts of British dragons, preserved in [Western European chronicles](../../Western-Europe/Historical-Timeline/README.md), provide a mythic backdrop for Stonehenge as a draconic gathering site.
