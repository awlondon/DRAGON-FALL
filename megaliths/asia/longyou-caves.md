# Longyou Caves

## Overview
Located in Zhejiang, China, the Longyou Caves comprise man‑made subterranean chambers carved into siltstone, likely during the Qin or early Han period. The Ancient Connection stresses the caves' smooth walls and unexplained excavation methods as enduring enigmas[^1].

## Dragon hypothesis
Earth‑dwelling dragons may have melted and evaporated rock with steady heat, leaving chisel‑like striations as claw marks. The vast halls could have incubated dragon broods, harnessing geomagnetic currents to regulate egg development.

## Connections to dragon lore
- The protective ambitions of the [Longwei lineage](../../China/Lineages/Longwei/README.md) mirror the strategic use of hidden chambers to guard imperial relics.
