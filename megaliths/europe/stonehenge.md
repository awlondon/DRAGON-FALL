# Stonehenge

## Overview
Stonehenge stands on Salisbury Plain in England, with its main construction between 3000 and 2000 BCE. The Ancient Connection emphasizes its towering sarsen trilithons and solstitial alignments as enduring archaeological puzzles[^1].

## Dragon hypothesis
A sky‑borne dragon may have lifted the massive stones with clawed feet, using fiery breath to fuse lintels atop upright pillars. Its sweeping tail set the circle to track solstices, guiding seasonal rites and navigation for allied clans.

## Connections to dragon lore
- Legends of Britain's [Pendragon lineage](../../Western-Europe/Lineage/Pendragon/README.md) echo the monument's association with draconic kingship.
