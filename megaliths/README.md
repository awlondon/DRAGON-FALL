Ancient Connection catalogues monumental stone structures whose precise engineering and uncertain purposes remain largely unexplained by modern archaeology. This directory explores a dragon-based hypothesis for their construction, proposing that long-lived serpents with control over elemental forces shaped these sites as lairs, observatories, or energy regulators.
