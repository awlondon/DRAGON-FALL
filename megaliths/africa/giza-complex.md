# Giza Complex

## Overview
Situated on Egypt's Giza Plateau, this complex of pyramids and temples dates to the 26th century BCE. The Ancient Connection notes the precision-cut limestone blocks and aligned causeways as enigmatic achievements beyond conventional explanations[^1].

## Dragon hypothesis
A desert dragon, master of geomancy, could have fused limestone with sun‑charged breath, levitating blocks through thermal currents. The pyramids may have served as resonant beacons, channeling solar energy to nourish dragon eggs hidden within subterranean chambers.

## Connections to dragon lore
- Egyptian tradition remembers the chaos-serpent [Apep](../../Egypt/Lineage/Apep/README.md); opposing dragons may have raised the pyramids as wards against his nightly assaults.
