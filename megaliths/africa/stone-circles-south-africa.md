# Stone Circles of South Africa

## Overview
Located across Mpumalanga and neighboring provinces, these concentric stone rings are attributed to early agro-pastoral communities but lack definitive dating. The Ancient Connection highlights their peculiar layouts and absence of habitation debris, leaving mainstream archaeology uncertain about their purpose[^1].

## Dragon hypothesis
A terrestrial dragon could have scorched and softened the region's dolerite, arranging the stones into resonant circles to channel earth energies. Its massive coils would guide the alignment, while rhythmic wingbeats compacted soil into raised terraces for ritual gatherings.

## Connections to dragon lore
- Fire-shaped stones recall techniques described in the [Triphasic Breath](../../Dragon%20Mechanics/Triphasic-Breath.md), suggesting dragons used layered flames to vitrify rock.
