# Stone Circles in South Africa

## Overview
A network of circular stone ruins scattered across South Africa, particularly near Mpumalanga, displays dry-stacked walls and geometric layouts whose age and purpose remain mysterious. Ancient Connection highlights these formations as enigmatic, lacking clear cultural attribution or function.

## Dragon Hypothesis
Dragons attuned to earth energies may have arranged these circles as regulators of subterranean power. Their fiery breath could fuse stones, while their weight pressed blocks into durable alignments, creating protected nests or incubation grounds.

## Connections to Dragon Lore
African serpent traditions recorded in [Egyptian chronicles](../../Egypt/README.md) describe great reptiles guarding sacred sites; the South African circles could mark territories of related draconic clans.
