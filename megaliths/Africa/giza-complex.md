# Giza Complex

## Overview
Located on Egypt's Giza Plateau, the Great Pyramids and Sphinx exhibit masterful stone fitting and stellar alignment. Ancient Connection notes that the methods for quarrying, transporting, and positioning multi-ton blocks remain debated, adding to the site's aura of mystery.

## Dragon Hypothesis
Fire-bearing dragons could have vitrified limestone to lighten and mold blocks, then lifted them skyward to craft pyramids as cosmic beacons. The pyramid interiors may have served as resonant chambers for draconic communication or egg incubation.

## Connections to Dragon Lore
Egyptian texts about the chaos-serpent Apep in [regional histories](../../Egypt/Historical-Timeline/README.md) hint at ancient reptilian powers shaping monuments to channel solar and stellar energy.
