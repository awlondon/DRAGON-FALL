# Yonaguni Monument

## Overview
Submerged off Japan's Yonaguni Island, this step-like stone formation descends into the sea with sharp angles and terrace edges. Ancient Connection flags the monument as controversial—possibly natural, possibly carved—leaving its origin an open mystery.

## Dragon Hypothesis
Sea dragons may have sculpted the terraces as underwater waypoints or lairs, using pressure and heated currents to shear rock while patrolling migration routes.

## Connections to Dragon Lore
Legends of Ryūjin in [Japanese timelines](../../Japan/Historical-Timeline/README.md) describe dragons ruling the oceans; the monument could mark one of their gateways between surface and deep.
