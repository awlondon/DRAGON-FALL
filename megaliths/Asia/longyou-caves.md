# Longyou Caves

## Overview
Discovered in Zhejiang province, China, the Longyou Caves are vast man-made chambers carved into sandstone, featuring symmetrical pillars and mysterious tool marks. Ancient Connection notes the absence of historical records and the precision of excavation, leaving scholars puzzled.

## Dragon Hypothesis
Earth-dwelling dragons could have melted and clawed through sandstone to create subterranean vaults for sheltering eggs or storing treasures, later flooding selective chambers to regulate humidity and temperature.

## Connections to Dragon Lore
The martial [Longwei lineage](../../China/Lineages/Longwei/README.md) chronicles dragon guardianship of imperial sites; the caves may represent their ancestral incubation halls.
