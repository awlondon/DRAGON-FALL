# Yonaguni Monument

## Overview
Submerged off Japan's Ryukyu Islands, the Yonaguni Monument displays stepped terraces and sharp-angled blocks. The Ancient Connection remarks that its geometric forms and unclear origin defy natural explanation, leaving debates over whether it is man-made[^1].

## Dragon hypothesis
A sea dragon could have carved the plateau into an undersea palace, using hydrodynamic pressure to shear sandstone layers. Alignments with rising stars may have guided migratory routes or served as a submerged observatory accessible only to aquatic dragon clans.

## Connections to dragon lore
- The monument's marine setting recalls the artistry of [Japanese dragon iconography](../../Japan/Iconography/README.md), where water dragons rule coastal realms.
