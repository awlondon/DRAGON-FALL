# Ollantaytambo

## Overview
Ollantaytambo, in Peru's Sacred Valley, features terraced walls and precisely interlocking andesite blocks dating to the Inca Empire. The Ancient Connection points to its polygonal masonry and unfinished monoliths as enigmas of engineering and intent[^1].

## Dragon hypothesis
A feathered serpent might have carved the terraces with acidâ€‘laced breath, hauling blocks along its undulating body. The site could have functioned as a ceremonial runway, aligning with celestial paths used for seasonal migrations of dragonkin.

## Connections to dragon lore
- The precision stonework resonates with the [Quetzalcoatl lineage](../../Mesoamerica/Lineage/Quetzalcoatl/README.md), whose followers were said to teach masonry and star lore.
