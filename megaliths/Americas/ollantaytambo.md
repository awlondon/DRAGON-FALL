# Ollantaytambo

## Overview
High in Peru's Sacred Valley, the Inca fortress of Ollantaytambo features terraced hillsides and precisely fitted andesite blocks weighing many tons. Ancient Connection describes the complex as puzzling for its altitude and the effort required to quarry and transport its stones.

## Dragon Hypothesis
Mountain-dwelling dragons could have carved and heated the andesite with volcanic breath, then used their strength to lift blocks into defensive terraces that doubled as roosts overlooking trade routes.

## Connections to Dragon Lore
Feathered-serpent traditions chronicled in [Mesoamerican records](../../Mesoamerica/Historical-Timeline/README.md) provide cultural echoes that link Andean megaliths to broader draconic mythologies across the Americas.
