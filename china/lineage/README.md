# Dragon-Blessed Lineages

Certain clans within the empire trace their bloodlines to the favor or ancestry of celestial dragons. These dragon-blessed families inherit unique traits, duties, and prestige that set them apart from ordinary lineages.

## Major Clans
- [Huanglong](huanglong/): Heirs of the Yellow Dragon who safeguard the imperial mandate and uphold harmony across the realm.
- [Longwei](longwei/): Martial descendants whose scaled champions defend the borders with ferocious discipline.
- [Qinglong](qinglong/): Scholars of the Azure Dragon, attuned to the winds and tides and keepers of ancient lore.
- [Yanlong](yanlong/): Artisans blessed with searing breath, forging arms and relics in draconic fire.
- [Zhilong](zhilong/): Visionaries guided by the Indigo Dragon, interpreting omens and steering the empire's fate.

## Adding a New Lineage
1. Create a folder under `China/Lineage/` named after the new clan.
2. Add a `README.md` in that folder detailing the lineage's origin, gifts, and role in the setting.
3. Update this index with a concise synopsis and link to the new entry so others can discover it.
