### Notes on Archival Classification Practices
- **Provenance-based arrangement**: Chinese archives follow a hierarchical "fonds–series–file–item" structure; records remain grouped by creating agency and arranged chronologically (State Archives Administration 1987).
- **Library classification codes**: The Chinese Library Classification (CLC) files mythology and dragon studies under codes such as K875.5 (folklore—myths & legends) and I207.2 (classical Chinese mythology). Pre-Qin histories fall under K203, while dynastic histories carry successive K20-series numbers.
- **Institutional holdings**:
  - Pre-Qin and imperial manuscripts reside in the National Library of China and the First Historical Archives (Beijing).
  - Republican-era documents are held in the Second Historical Archives (Nanjing), catalogued by ministry and chronological sequence.
  - PRC state records are managed by the Central Archives, with security classifications ("open," "restricted," "secret") determining access.
- **Finding aids**: Researchers often cross-reference CLC numbers with subject terms like *long* (dragon) in archival catalogs; digital platforms (e.g., National Digital Library's "Mythology" portal) mirror these classifications for online retrieval.
