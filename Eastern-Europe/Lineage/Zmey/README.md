# Zmey

## Mythic Origins
- The *zmey* is a multi-headed dragon or serpent from Slavic folklore, often breathing fire and inhabiting mountains or caves.[^1]
- Scholars trace the figure to Indo-European storm-serpent myths that spread through early Slavic societies.[^2]

## Regional Variants
- Russian epics depict **Zmey Gorynych**, typically with three heads, as an adversary for heroes like Dobrynya Nikitich.[^1]
- In Bulgaria and the Balkans, *zmey* may appear as a benevolent guardian spirit or a shape-shifting suitor of mortals.[^3]

## Historical Significance and Cross-Cultural Ties
- The dragon-slayer motif became a staple of Slavic heroic songs, symbolizing the triumph of order over chaos and foreign invaders.[^2]
- Steppe interactions brought Turkic and Tatar influences; features of the *zmey* echo Central Asian dragons and link to the Tatar **zilant** tradition.[^4]
