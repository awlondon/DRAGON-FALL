# Zilant

## Mythic Origins
- **Zilant** is a winged serpent or dragon rooted in Tatar folklore and associated with the founding legends of Kazan.[^1]
- Its image blends Turkic steppe serpent lore with broader Central Asian dragon motifs such as the Iranian *Aži Dahāka*.[^2]

## Regional Variants
- In Kazan, the creature appears on the city coat of arms as a crowned, winged serpent with birdlike legs.[^3]
- Volga Bulgar and other Tatar traditions portray Zilant as either a malevolent guardian of treasure or a protective spirit of the land.[^1]

## Historical Significance and Cross-Cultural Ties
- After Ivan IV's conquest of Kazan (1552), Russian heraldry incorporated Zilant, symbolizing the subjugated yet resilient Tatar identity.[^2]
- Shared dragon motifs with Slavic *zmey* narratives highlight cultural exchange across the Eurasian steppe.[^3]
