# Lineage

Priests of Marduk traced a ritual lineage to those who recited the *Enuma Elish* during Akitu festivals, asserting authority over chaotic serpents like Tiamat.^[1^] Parallel cults celebrated protective dragons such as Ušumgallu, linking their rites to serpent guardians in [Egypt](../../egypt/lineage/README.md).^[2^]
