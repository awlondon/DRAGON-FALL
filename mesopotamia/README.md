# Mesopotamia

Mesopotamian mythology casts dragons as embodiments of primordial chaos and imperial might. The *Enuma Elish* recounts the sea-dragon Tiamat's defeat by Marduk to forge the ordered world, while the lion-serpent *mushussu* became a heraldic beast of Babylon.^[1^][2^] These narratives resonate along the Nile where Egypt's Apep also battles solar deities, highlighting cultural exchange across the ancient Near East.^[3^] For parallel serpent myths, consult [Egypt](../egypt/README.md).
